CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindGStreamer.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "GStreamer", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "GStreamer" with
  any of the following names:

    GStreamerConfig.cmake
    gstreamer-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "GStreamer" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "GStreamer_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "GStreamer" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
